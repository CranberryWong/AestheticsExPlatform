            <p class="card-text">Why we are doing this research: We are trying to understand what makes graphic user interfaces(In this test: webpages) look visually appealing. More specifically, the goal of this study is to find out a mathematic model to predict our visual preferences, and further, to develop aesthetic optimization for interface design. What you will have to do: You will be shown screenshots of websites. You will then be asked to rate each one on a scale from 1 to 9 based on visual appeal. Your participation in this study is completely voluntary, and you may refuse to participate or withdraw from the study without penalty or loss of benefits to which you may otherwise be entitled. What you will get out of it: We will give you feedback on how your results compare to those of other participants. The final results from this experiment will be posted on our page. The experiment is not designed to benefit you, but you may enjoy it and enjoy comparing your results with those of other participants. Any data that we collect will be securely stored on our servers. </p>
